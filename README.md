# EPL_Predictive_Model_GUI
Predictive Model for EPL Player Performance with GUI


### Key features:
- Data collected for the top 20 EPL players from each season (2020, 2021, 2022).
- The model performs multiple regression predictions based on user inputs, such as goals, assists, pass accuracy, and more.
- A GUI built using Python PyQt allows users to interact with the model, providing input and receiving predictions in real-time.
- Predictions are displayed with currency symbols and rounded to two decimal places, with a focus on minimizing standard error.
