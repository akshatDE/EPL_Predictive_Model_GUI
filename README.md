# EPL_Predictive_Model_GUI
Predictive Model for EPL Player Performance with GUI


Description:
This project aims to build a user-friendly predictive model for forecasting the performance of English Premier League (EPL) players based on historical data from the 2020, 2021, and 2022 seasons. The model uses multiple regression analysis to predict outcomes like goals, assists, and other performance metrics based on various player attributes.

Key features:
	•	Data collected for the top 20 EPL players from each season (2020, 2021, 2022).
	•	The model performs multiple regression predictions based on user inputs, such as goals, assists, pass accuracy, and more.
	•	A GUI built using Python Tkinter allows users to interact with the model, providing input and receiving predictions in real-time.
	•	Predictions are displayed with currency symbols and rounded to two decimal places, with a focus on minimizing standard error.

Technologies Used:
	•	Python (pandas, scikit-learn, PyQt)
	•	SQLite for data storage
	•	GitHub for version control and project management
